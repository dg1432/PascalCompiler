# Pascal Compiler
This is my project series that I worked on the Fall 2014 semester for Compiler Construction (CS 4013) at The University of Tulsa. I have not updated any code or report content and do not plan to. All that I have done is migrated the reports from Microsoft Word documents to GitHub READMEs for better readability.
